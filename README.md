2021 MBA Thesis Project (WSU Carson College of Business)

-- Included in this repository is an extensive glimpse into the data analytics, visualization and SAS that I have conducted as part of my MBA thesis project. Deliverables include: Excel files, data analysis projects, dashboards, storyboarding, pitchdecks, and statistical analysis instances.  

--  Background: As a team of four, our 'Capstone' group has chosen to integrate a key Job to be Done (JTBD). **Notably, our job opportunity is a workflow data and productivity perservation solution (SaaS), which is currently in an industry with significant demand creation and switch dynamic potential. Notably, our solution "Microsoft Vault" aims to leverage the MS 365 and Azure Cloud platform to offer a significantly streamlined and user-friendly version of workflow preservation software (i.e. SharePoint, Google Drive, etc.) that organizations can leverage to save time and money.** 

-- Ultimately, our job opportunity 'MS Vault' will be pitched to faculty at WSU as well as provided the opportunity to be considered by outside investors in late 2021.
